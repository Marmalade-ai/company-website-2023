Marmalade provides an easy way for every specialist in UX design, digital marketing, and machine learning\n      to network virtually. It targets people who really need to connect to each other and find traditional\n      networking through meetups or one-on-ones, or through online services like Linkedin, TopTal, UpWork, or Indeed\n      to be not all that useful, too expensive for the value received, and too time-consuming. Using their profiles, \n      Marmalade AI automatically creates a network of specialists that is virtual, by using NLP (natural language processing) and \n      ML (machine learning) to suggest relevant connections. When, where, and with who you connect is under your \n      control.
