They could be helpful, but they don't know.\n      3) Inefficiency: Networking can be powerful. But there's only so much time you can put into it.\n      We found each other through user research into networking, then connected remotely, and developed a prototype in Figma.\n      Software development prototyping for a web subscription service was done in Vue with a GCP backend. We wanted an exceptionally easy-to-use,\n      &quot;responsive&quot; interaction that could work equally well on phones, laptops, and desktops.

But there's only so much time you can put into it. \n               It takes a lot of work for meager results.

More recently, many companies require returning to the office.\n              However, remote has levelled off at 28% of all work; a big increase and it is no longer going up or down. \n            </p>\n            <br/>\n\n            <p>The <b>big picture</b> is that we need to dramatically reduce our ecological footprint and increase our ability to work with different cultures. \n              It just takes time to assimilate a change this big into work.
