The best result\n      would be: just have a profile, and automatically create a professional network based on your profile. That is\n      what the virtual networking subscription service by Marmalade AI, Inc. does. Marmalade provides an easy way for every specialist in UX design, digital marketing, and machine learning\n      to network virtually. It targets people who really need to connect to each other and find traditional\n      networking through meetups or one-on-ones, or through online services like Linkedin, TopTal, UpWork, or Indeed\n      to be not all that useful, too expensive for the value received, and too time-consuming. Using their profiles, \n      Marmalade AI automatically creates a network of specialists that is virtual, by using NLP (natural language processing) and \n      ML (machine learning) to suggest relevant connections. When, where, and with who you connect is under your \n      control. Marmalade AI is a subscription web-based service in the U.S. on phones, laptops, and desktops.\"\n    />\n  </>\n);\n\nconst IndexPage = () => {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n      <main>\n        <body>\n          <div className=\"container flex flex-col\">\n            <div className=\"grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-5\">\n              <div>\n                <h1 className=\"largeText gap-5\"><i>Automatic</i> Networking</h1>\n              </div>\n                <button \n                  className=\"w-32 bg-[#ff7f00] bg-opacity-50 border border-width-1 hover:underline px-2 py-1 rounded-lg text-black float-right\" \n                  onClick={()=>{navigate(\"https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1eu_w17ssDesxl9iYB2DYgmg_sldKc3q_qBu0EuSAz1g/\")}}>\n                    Waitlist me!\n                </button>\n                {/* button hover:underline px-2 bg-marmalade-200 float-right */}\n            </div>\n            <br/>\n            <div className=\"grid sm:grid-cols-1 gap-5\">\n        \n            </div>\n            <div  className=\"grid sm:grid-cols-1 gap-5\">\n              <p>What if, given my profile, an app could automatically and accurately network me -- <i><u>virtually</u></i>?</p>\n              \n              <p>Marmalade AI is <b><i>automatic</i></b> and <b><i>accurate</i></b>.
