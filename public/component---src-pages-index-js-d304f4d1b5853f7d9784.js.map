The best result\n      would be: just have a profile, and automatically create a professional network based on your profile. That is\n      what the professional networking subscription service by Marmalade AI, Inc. does. Marmalade provides an easy way for every specialist in UX design, digital marketing, and machine learning\n      to network virtually. It targets people who really need to connect to each other and find traditional\n      networking through meetups or one-on-ones, or through online services like Linkedin, TopTal, UpWork, or Indeed\n      to be not all that useful, too expensive for the value received, and too time-consuming. Using their profiles, \n      Marmalade AI automatically creates a network of specialists that is virtual, by using NLP (natural language processing) and \n      ML (machine learning) to suggest relevant connections. When, where, and with who you connect is under your \n      control. Marmalade AI is a subscription web-based service in the U.S. on phones, laptops, and desktops.\"\n    />\n  </>\n);\n\n\nconst IndexPage = () => {\n  return (\n    <Layout>\n\n    <main>\n      <p class=\"w-96 pt-6 pb-6 text-5xl font-extrabold\">Professional Networking for Specialists</p>\n      <hr/>\n      <div  className=\"grid sm:grid-cols-2 gap-5\">\n        <div>\n          <p>What if, given my profile, I automatically had an accurate virtual network? \n          </p>\n        </div>\n        <div>\n          <p>Marmalade enables you to do just that, starting in 2023 in <b>UX design</b>, <b>digital marketing</b>, and <b>machine learning</b>. \n          Traditional networking is so much work for so little gain.
