All\n          information provided to Marmalade AI is transmitted using SSL (Secure\n          Socket Layer) encryption. SSL is a proven coding system that allows\n          your browser to automatically encrypt, or scramble, data before you\n          send it to us. To prevent unauthorized access or disclosure, to\n          maintain data accuracy, and to ensure the appropriate use of the\n          information, Marmalade AI utilizes reasonable and appropriate\n          technical and administrative procedures to safeguard the information\n          we collect and process. We protect account information by placing it\n          on a secure portion of our website that is only accessible by certain\n          qualified employees of Marmalade AI. Unfortunately, however, no data\n          transmission over the internet is 100 percent secure. While we strive\n          to protect your information, we cannot ensure or warrant the security\n          of such information. We strongly advise you not to share your password\n          with anyone.\n        </p>\n\n        <h2>Changes to the Privacy Notice</h2>\n        <p>\n          Changes may be made to this Privacy Notice and personal information\n          may be used for new purposes.
